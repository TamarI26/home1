I built an image website about myself, the website contains relevant details about my life and what I do.
On the website have 4 pages:
The home page - where a general background about myself is presented
About  - more detail about myself and my ambitions
Resume - there you can see my educational and professional background
Projects - recent projects I worked on.

The things that challenged me are responsibility and animation, because they are things that we did not delve into in class, I had to use the internet a lot, to understand better how to meet the requirements.
I discovered a wide world of options for design and animation, I expanded my knowledge of java script and above all I realized that there are many things that can be learned on your own.
New things I learned are: 
animation
@keyframes
@media
transition
transfrom
z-index
