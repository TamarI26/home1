        <h2><i>Background</i></h2>
    <p>
        The pineapple(Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with an edible fruit, it 
        is the most economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae.
        The pineapple is indigenous to South America, where it has been cultivated for many centuries. The introduction of the pineapple
        to Europe in the 17th century made it a significant cultural icon of luxury. Since the 1820s, pineapple has been 
        commercially grown in greenhouses and many tropical plantations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pineapples grow as a small shrub; the individual flowers of the unpollinated plant fuse to form a
        multiple fruit. The plant normally propagates from the offset produced at the top of the fruit
        or from a side shoot, and typically matures within a year.
    </p>
    <p>
        Christopher Columbus brought pineapples back to Europe after an expedition to South America.
        Pineapples became known as an extravagant and exotic fruit, served only at the most lavish of banquets.However, pineapples are now common,
        and people are able to enjoy them in solid, dried, and juice forms.
        In Central and South America, pineapple is not only valued for its sweet taste, it has been used for centuries to treat digestion problems and inflammation.

    <h2 id="benefits"><i>Benefits</i></h2>
    <h3><u>Support Gut Health</u></h3>
    <p>
      Pineapple contains bromelain, a digestive enzyme that can break down structural proteins and support absorption in the small intestine.
      This aid in digestion may be especially helpful for those living with pancreatic insufficiency, a medical condition in which the pancreas doesn't make enough digestive enzymes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, bromelain can break down tough meat proteins, which is why it is often used as a meat tenderizer
        in the commercial setting. Many cultures pair pineapple with cooked meats to help tenderize the meat and make for a more pleasurable digestion experience.  
    </p>
    <h3><u>Support Recovery</u></h3>
    <p>
        Pineapple may reduce the time it takes to recover after exercise and surgery. The carbs in pineapple can help replenish the energy lost during a workout,
         and the bromelin may offer anti-inflammatory benefits after surgery.
    </p>
    <p>
        Research also points to a promising role for bromelin in surgical care. It may reduce the inflammation, swelling, bruising, and pain that can occur after dental and skin surgeries.6 Still,
        while pineapple's effects on recovery are promising, there is a need for continued research to understand its capabilities better

            Beta-blockers, a type of medication most commonly prescribed for heart disease, can cause potassium levels to increase in the blood. 
            High potassium foods should be consumed in moderation when taking beta-blockers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consuming too much potassium can be harmful to people whose kidneys are not fully functional. 
            If your kidneys are unable to remove excess potassium from the blood, it could be fatal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those with gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) may experience an increase in symptoms, such as heartburn and regurgitation,
